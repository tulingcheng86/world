My name is Max Azzarello, and I am an investigative researcher who has set himself on fire outside of the Trump trial in Manhattan.
我叫马克斯·阿扎雷洛，我是一名调查研究员，在曼哈顿的特朗普审判之外自焚。

This extreme act of protest is to draw attention to an urgent and important discovery:
这种极端的抗议行为是为了引起人们对一个紧迫而重要的发现的关注：

We are victims of a totalitarian con, and our own government (along with many of their allies) is about to hit us with an apocalyptic fascist world coup.
我们是极权主义骗局的受害者，我们自己的政府（以及他们的许多盟友）即将用世界末日的法西斯世界政变袭击我们。

These claims sound like fantastical conspiracy theory, but they are not. They are proof of conspiracy. If you investigate this mountain of research, you will prove them too. If you learn a great deal about Ponzi schemes, you will discover that our life is a lie. If you follow this story and the links below, you will discover the rotten truth of ‘post-truth America’. You will learn the scariest and stupidest story in world history. And you will realize that we are all in a desperate state of emergency that requires your action.
这些说法听起来像是天方夜谭的阴谋论，但事实并非如此。它们是阴谋的证据。如果你调查这堆积如山的研究，你也会证明它们。如果你对庞氏骗局了解很多，你会发现我们的生活是一个谎言。如果你关注这个故事和下面的链接，你会发现“后真相美国”的腐朽真相。您将了解世界历史上最可怕和最愚蠢的故事。你们将意识到，我们都处于一种绝望的紧急状态，需要你们采取行动。

To my friends and family, witnesses and first responders, I deeply apologize for inflicting this pain upon you. But I assure you it is a drop in the bucket compared to what our government intends to inflict.
对于我的朋友和家人、目击者和急救人员，我为给你们带来这种痛苦深表歉意。但我向你保证，与我们政府打算施加的相比，这只是杯水车薪。

Because these words are true, this is an act of revolution.
因为这些话是真的，所以这是一种革命行为。

Last March, a billionaire named Peter Thiel started a bank run on Silicon Valley Bank. I knew enough about Thiel that I found this incredibly suspicious: My hunch was that this was intentional, though I couldn’t fathom why.
去年三月，一位名叫彼得·泰尔（Peter Thiel）的亿万富翁开始了对硅谷银行的银行挤兑。我对泰尔的了解足够多，以至于我发现这非常可疑：我的预感是这是故意的，尽管我无法理解为什么。

I began investigating online, and quickly found cryptocurrency’s fingerprints all over it. The bank run occurred just days after Silvergate Bank – which catered almost exclusively to crypto companies – collapsed. Meanwhile, several crypto cheerleaders were all over financial media warning of a regional banking crisis, and nobody in media was addressing the clear crypto connections.
我开始在网上调查，很快就发现了加密货币的指纹。银行挤兑发生在Silvergate Bank（几乎只为加密公司提供服务）倒闭几天后。与此同时，几位加密货币啦啦队员在金融媒体上警告地区银行业危机，媒体中没有人关注明显的加密货币联系。

I dug deep into the financials of Thiel’s venture capital firm Founders Fund and eventually uncovered the following, all proven many times over.
我深入研究了 Thiel 的风险投资公司 Founders Fund 的财务状况，并最终发现了以下内容，所有这些都被多次证明。

Cryptocurrency is our first planetary multi-trillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. It was expressly created for this purpose by a laundry list of rich and powerful people out of Stanford/Silicon Valley and Harvard/Facebook.
加密货币是我们第一个全球数万亿美元的庞氏骗局。它是由斯坦福大学/硅谷和哈佛大学/Facebook的一群有钱有势的人专门为此目的创建的。

The March 2023 bank failures were all intentional: the banks were used to move out stolen Ponzi money. This signals that they’re no longer dumping cash in to keep the cryptocurrency Ponzi afloat, and that it will soon go insolvent, as all Ponzis must.
2023 年 3 月的银行倒闭都是故意的：银行被用来转移被盗的庞氏骗局。这表明他们不再倾销现金来维持加密货币庞氏骗局的运营，而且它很快就会破产，就像所有庞齐人都必须的那样。

When the Ponzi scheme goes insolvent, it will take down half the stock market with it: The perpetrators used their major companies to pipe into the blockchain so they could funnel money out from the crypto exchanges. This includes Google, Tesla, Apple, PayPal, Facebook, Disney, Walmart, Target, InBev, Zoom, and countless others.
当庞氏骗局破产时，它将带走一半的股票市场：肇事者利用他们的主要公司进入区块链，这样他们就可以从加密货币交易所汇出资金。这包括谷歌，特斯拉，苹果，PayPal，Facebook，迪士尼，沃尔玛，塔吉特，英博，Zoom和无数其他公司。

It is a Ponzi scheme so large that it created global inflation, which is why the price of Bitcoin has been a remarkable leading indicator for inflation rates. Victims who bought crypto don’t realize their money has already been stolen, so the money gets double-counted by the victims and the criminals who stole it.
这是一个庞氏骗局，规模如此之大，以至于造成了全球通货膨胀，这就是为什么比特币的价格一直是通货膨胀率的一个显着领先指标。购买加密货币的受害者没有意识到他们的钱已经被盗，因此受害者和偷窃它的犯罪分子会重复计算这笔钱。

As it turns out, our elites are awash in Ponzi schemes. Stanford’s StartX.com investment fund and Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘Program for Evolutionary Dynamics’ he ran at Harvard are both fake-science Ponzi factories that these schools have invested billions in: They are filled with fraudulent companies that use smoke and mirrors to promise miraculous new technology, but always collapse while the perpetrators only get richer.
事实证明，我们的精英们充斥着庞氏骗局。斯坦福大学的 StartX.com 投资基金和杰弗里·爱泼斯坦（Jeffrey Epstein）在哈佛大学（Harvard）运营的“进化动力学项目”（Program for Evolutionary Dynamics）都是假科学的庞氏骗局，这些学校已经投资了数十亿美元：它们充斥着欺诈性公司，这些公司利用烟雾和镜子来承诺神奇的新技术，但总是在肇事者变得更富有时倒闭。

Funneling trillions of dollars in stolen cash through the stock market created the largest stock-market anomaly in history. The stock chart signature of a Ponzi scheme is a massive increase (while they stack up cash) and then a massive fall (as they funnel out the stolen cash). This chart shape appeared in all the companies listed above. In order to explain the massive anomaly, our criminal government unleashed COVID on the world and told us these were the “stay at home stocks.”
通过股票市场输送数万亿美元的被盗现金造成了历史上最大的股票市场异常现象。庞氏骗局的股票图表特征是大幅上涨（当他们堆积现金时），然后大幅下跌（因为他们将被盗现金汇出）。此图表形状出现在上面列出的所有公司中。为了解释这种巨大的异常现象，我们的犯罪政府向世界释放了新冠病毒，并告诉我们这些是“待在家里的股票”。

Ponzi schemes are vicious beasts, and cryptocurrency is history’s largest Ponzi by orders of magnitude. It could best be described as an economic doomsday device, intentionally made to shatter the world economy.
庞氏骗局是凶恶的野兽，加密货币是历史上最大的庞氏骗局。它最好被描述为一种经济末日装置，故意破坏世界经济。

The U.S. government is fully involved in this totalitarian con: To illustrate its bipartisan support, I’ll note that nearly every participant of the Clinton Global Initiative has ties to cryptocurrency, while two of the biggest tech VCs who participated are Trump associates Josh Kushner and Anthony Scaramucci.
美国政府完全卷入了这场极权主义的骗局：为了说明其两党的支持，我要指出的是，克林顿全球倡议的几乎每个参与者都与加密货币有联系，而参与的两位最大的科技风险投资人是特朗普的同事乔什·库什纳（Josh Kushner）和安东尼·斯卡拉穆奇（Anthony Scaramucci）。

To better understand our form of government, I will point you to one of the most astonishing pieces of stand-alone evidence I’ve found: Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton’s 1988 DNC speech where he nominated Mike Dukakis for president against George H.W. Bush. The speech is a vile, mean-spirited roast of Dukakis that makes no sense whatsoever: For Clinton to ruthlessly attack a member of his own party should have been political suicide, and he repeatedly mocks Dukakis’ noble and earnest qualities.
为了更好地理解我们的政府形式，我将向你指出我发现的最令人惊讶的独立证据之一：阿肯色州州长比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）1988年在民主党全国委员会（DNC）的演讲，他提名迈克·杜卡基斯（Mike Dukakis）竞选总统，反对乔治·H·W·布什（George H.W. Bush）。这篇演讲是对杜卡基斯的卑鄙、卑鄙的抨击，没有任何意义：克林顿无情地攻击自己党内的一名成员应该是政治自杀，他一再嘲笑杜卡基斯高尚而认真的品质。

Notably, actor Rob Lowe, who was supporting Dukakis, was victim of a teen sex blackmail operation at the DNC that year. Since we know Clinton is a close associate with teen sex blackmail artist Jeffrey Epstein, we can suddenly make perfect sense of the nonsensical speech by applying this lens: Bill Clinton is a cocky mob boss who blackmailed Mike Dukakis because Dukakis thought his job was to help the public. He teases out the future public revelation that Kitty Dukakis drank rubbing alcohol, and offers a strange anecdote about the crack epidemic that reveals he is an exceedingly proud drug runner.
值得注意的是，支持杜卡基斯的演员罗伯·洛（Rob Lowe）是当年DNC青少年性勒索行动的受害者。由于我们知道克林顿与青少年性勒索艺术家杰弗里·爱泼斯坦（Jeffrey Epstein）关系密切，因此我们可以通过应用这个镜头突然完全理解荒谬的演讲：比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）是一个自大的黑帮老大，他勒索迈克·杜卡基斯（Mike Dukakis），因为杜卡基斯认为他的工作是帮助公众。他嘲笑了基蒂·杜卡基斯（Kitty Dukakis）喝外用酒精的未来公开启示，并提供了一个关于快克流行病的奇怪轶事，揭示了他是一个非常自豪的贩毒者。

What does this revelation tell us? That our government is conning us completely. That Bill Clinton was secretly on (former CIA Director) George H.W. Bush’s side, and that the Democrat vs. Republican division has been entirely manufactured ever since: Clinton is with Bush; Gore is with Bush; Trump is with Hillary, and so on. When they present themselves in public, they are acting as characters that are against one another, practicing kayfabe as wrestlers do.
这个启示告诉我们什么？我们的政府完全在欺骗我们。比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）秘密地站在（前中央情报局局长）乔治·H·W·布什（George H.W. Bush）一边，从那时起，民主党与共和党的分歧就完全被捏造了：克林顿与布什在一起;戈尔与布什同在;特朗普和希拉里在一起，等等。当他们在公共场合展示自己时，他们扮演着相互对立的角色，像摔跤手一样练习 kayfabe。

As it turns out, we have a secret kleptocracy: Both parties are run by financial criminals whose only goals are to divide, deceive, and bleed us dry. They divide the public against itself and blame the other party while everything gets worse and more expensive and handful of people take all the money.
事实证明，我们有一个秘密的盗贼统治：双方都由金融犯罪分子管理，他们的唯一目标是分裂、欺骗和流血。他们分裂公众反对自己并指责对方，而一切都变得更糟，越来越昂贵，少数人拿走了所有的钱。

Since it is fully parasitic, a secret kleptocracy is an incredibly unstable form of government – left to its own devices, it can only lead to fascism or failed state.
由于它是完全寄生的，秘密的盗贼统治是一种非常不稳定的政府形式——任其自生自灭，它只会导致法西斯主义或失败的国家。

One of the key findings of this research is that Harvard University is one of the largest organized crime fronts in history, which is how they churn out billionaires – it’s a major hub of this sprawling criminal network.
这项研究的主要发现之一是，哈佛大学是历史上最大的有组织犯罪阵线之一，这就是他们培养亿万富翁的方式——它是这个庞大的犯罪网络的主要枢纽。

As it turns out, dozens of the writers of The Simpsons went to Harvard. So I asked myself the question: If The Simpsons served the interests of organized crime, how would it do so?
事实证明，《辛普森一家》的数十位作家都去了哈佛。所以我问自己一个问题：如果《辛普森一家》符合有组织犯罪的利益，它将如何做到这一点？

Well, it offers a dysfunctional family suffering from moral decay, a community incapable of solving its problems, a worker drone who slaves away for an evil billionaire, and cathartic laughs for our poor collective circumstances.
好吧，它提供了一个道德沦丧的功能失调的家庭，一个无法解决问题的社区，一个为邪恶的亿万富翁奴役的工人无人机，以及为我们可怜的集体环境宣泄的笑声。

There are some notable specifics as it relates to this research, too: In Marge vs. The Monorail, the townsfolk are too oafish and divided to invest in the town’s needs (fix Main Street) and fall for the charms of a dazzling showman with a bogus monorail Ponzi scheme. When we know that the show is closely linked to an organization that invests billions of dollars in Ponzi factories, this becomes quite damning.
在这项研究中也有一些值得注意的细节：在《玛吉大战单轨列车》中，镇民们太过分割和分裂，无法投资于城镇的需求（修复主街），并被一个令人眼花缭乱的表演者的魅力所迷惑，并有一个虚假的单轨庞氏骗局。当我们知道该节目与一个在庞氏工厂投资数十亿美元的组织密切相关时，这变得非常可怕。

In Lisa the Iconoclast, Lisa discovers that town founder Jebediah Springfield was a secret criminal con artist, and that the townsfolk’s lives are a lie. Realizing this is an important discovery, she desperately tries to get the townsfolk to listen to her. But they meet her with hostility, apathy, disbelief, and partisanship and she fails to get through to them. Ultimately, she realizes the town is so far gone that perhaps it’s better for them to be lied to by con artists, and she keeps the secret to herself.
在《偶像破坏者丽莎》中，丽莎发现小镇创始人杰贝迪亚·斯普林菲尔德是一个秘密的犯罪骗子，而镇民的生活是谎言。意识到这是一个重要的发现，她拼命地试图让镇上的人听她的话。但他们以敌意、冷漠、怀疑和党派之争来迎接她，而她却无法与他们取得联系。最终，她意识到这个小镇已经消失得太远了，也许他们被骗子骗了会更好，她把这个秘密留给了自己。

And here I’ve been, like Lisa Simpson, desperately trying to get friends, family, and the public to believe the proof of a totalitarian con I’m trying to show them, and they’ve turned away with hostility, apathy, disbelief, and partisanship.
在这里，我就像丽莎·辛普森（Lisa Simpson）一样，拼命地试图让朋友、家人和公众相信我试图向他们展示的极权主义骗局的证据，而他们却带着敌意、冷漠、怀疑和党派之争转身离开。

And so, we realize the criminal truth of The Simpsons: Our elites are telling us that our eroding collective circumstances are our own fault, and we can’t do anything about it, while they steal the American Dream from us. It is, for lack of a more elegant word, brainwashing.
因此，我们意识到了《辛普森一家》的犯罪真相：我们的精英们告诉我们，我们不断恶化的集体环境是我们自己的错，我们对此无能为力，而他们却从我们这里偷走了美国梦。由于缺乏一个更优雅的词，这是洗脑。

Lastly, we string these major discoveries together: Cryptocurrency is an economic doomsday device; our government is a secret kleptocracy; The Simpsons exists to brainwash us. From there, the only research we need is critical thinking and we’re able to piece together the true story of our circumstances.
最后，我们将这些重大发现串联在一起：加密货币是一种经济末日装置;我们的政府是一个秘密的盗贼统治;辛普森一家的存在是为了给我们洗脑。从那里开始，我们唯一需要的研究就是批判性思维，我们能够拼凑出我们环境的真实故事。

Consider America since 1988: Institutions like healthcare and universities have become parasitic in their skyrocketing prices. News media tells us to be angry and tribalized. Daytime television warns us of moral decay. Local news tell us to fear our neighbors. The Simpsons tells us we’re too oafish and divided to save the American Dream. Seinfeld tells us to celebrate the assholes and be irritated by all the normal people around us. “Reality” TV tells us that real life is filled with hedonism and strife.
以1988年以来的美国为例：医疗保健和大学等机构已经寄生于价格飞涨。新闻媒体告诉我们要愤怒和部落化。白天的电视警告我们道德沦丧。当地新闻告诉我们要害怕我们的邻居。《辛普森一家》告诉我们，我们太过分，无法拯救美国梦。宋飞告诉我们要庆祝混蛋，并被我们周围的所有正常人激怒。“真人秀”告诉我们，现实生活充满了享乐主义和纷争。

Social media, owned by crypto criminals like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, is flooded with nonsense conspiracy theories and memes reminding us that we are hopeless, helpless, anxious, depressed, ironic, scared, apathetic, escapist, lonely, misguided, and jaded, telling us we can’t do anything but have a laugh at our circumstances.
马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）和埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）等加密犯罪分子拥有的社交媒体充斥着无稽之谈的阴谋论和模因，提醒我们绝望、无助、焦虑、沮丧、讽刺、害怕、冷漠、逃避现实、孤独、误导和厌倦，告诉我们我们无能为力，只能嘲笑我们的处境。

Liberals mock the hypocrisy of conservatives; conservatives mock the hypocrisy of liberals, and our collective circumstances erode. The left shouts “All Cops Are Bastards,” which ensures they’ll be hated by the police and the public (and flies in the face of leftist theory). The public’s distrust of the government is at an all-time high, but so is the belief that we are helpless to do anything about it.
自由主义者嘲笑保守派的虚伪;保守派嘲笑自由派的虚伪，我们的集体环境受到侵蚀。左派高喊“所有警察都是混蛋”，这确保了他们会被警察和公众憎恨（并且与左派理论背道而驰）。公众对政府的不信任达到了历史最高水平，但人们也认为我们对此无能为力。

And with all this, a sharp rise in apocalyptic messaging: Climate change will kill us all; COVID will kill us all; vaccines will kill us all; AI will kill us all – no matter the bubbles we ascribe to, we’re bombarded with existential crises with no solutions. We’ve seen a surge in apocalyptic film, literature, and video games that tell us there is no way out of our poor circumstances but total societal breakdown. Zombies tell us that the public is our enemy. If you go to your nearest convenience store, you can buy a can of water called “Liquid Death.”
随之而来的是世界末日信息的急剧上升：气候变化将杀死我们所有人;COVID将杀死我们所有人;疫苗会杀死我们所有人;人工智能将杀死我们所有人——无论我们归咎于什么泡沫，我们都被没有解决方案的生存危机轰炸。我们看到世界末日电影、文学和电子游戏的激增，它们告诉我们，除了彻底的社会崩溃之外，没有办法摆脱我们的贫困环境。僵尸告诉我们，公众是我们的敌人。如果你去最近的便利店，你可以买一罐叫做“Liquid Death”的水。

This is our rotten farce: For our entire lives, we have been flooded with media designed to slowly steer us into a world where the American Dream was dead, where the public was fully divided against itself, where everybody believed we were powerless to do anything about our worsening circumstances. It is all so they can organize an unprecedented, apocalyptic rug pull on the entire populace as they pivot to fascism, which is perhaps best understood as kleptocracy at the barrel of a gun.
这是我们的腐朽闹剧：在我们的一生中，我们一直充斥着媒体，这些媒体旨在慢慢地引导我们进入一个美国梦已经死去的世界，公众完全分裂，每个人都认为我们无能为力。这一切都是为了让他们在转向法西斯主义时组织一场前所未有的、世界末日式的地毯式拉扯，这也许最好被理解为枪管下的盗贼统治。

When we piece it all together, we understand the truth: We are in a totalitarian doomsday cult.
当我们把它们拼凑在一起时，我们就明白了真相：我们处于极权主义的世界末日崇拜中。

Why on earth would our elites do this? There are many reasons, but the simplest is because capitalism is unsustainable, and they knew it: Climate change and resource extraction would catch up eventually. So, they never intended to sustain it. They knew all along that they would gobble up all the wealth they could, and then yank the rug out from under us so they could pivot to a hellish fascist dystopia.
为什么我们的精英会这样做？原因有很多，但最简单的原因是因为资本主义是不可持续的，他们知道这一点：气候变化和资源开采最终会迎头赶上。所以，他们从未打算维持它。他们一直都知道，他们会吞噬所有可能的财富，然后从我们脚下扯出地毯，这样他们就可以转向地狱般的法西斯反乌托邦。

Things escalated wildly in 1988 when former CIA Director George H.W. Bush got the White House, but this plan had been in action long prior:
1988年，当前中央情报局局长乔治·H·W·布什（George H.W. Bush）入主白宫时，事情急剧升级，但这个计划早在很久以前就开始了：

Why is Stanley Kubrick’s comedy about mutually assured destruction called Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb? Because he was a cocky secret fascist who was getting us to stop worrying and love the bomb. Why did he make A Clockwork Orange? So we’d rejoice at ultra-violence designed to desensitize us to the horrors of the world.
为什么斯坦利·库布里克（Stanley Kubrick）关于相互确保毁灭的喜剧被称为《奇爱博士：或者，我如何学会停止担心并爱上炸弹》？因为他是一个自大的秘密法西斯主义者，他让我们停止担心并热爱炸弹。他为什么要制作《发条橙》？因此，我们会为旨在使我们对世界的恐怖麻木不仁的极端暴力感到高兴。

Why were the Manson Family murders crawling with cover-ups and intelligence agents? Because our government wanted to make us fear for our lives and believe that hippies are deranged psychopaths.
为什么曼森家族的谋杀案充斥着掩盖和情报人员？因为我们的政府想让我们担心自己的生命，并相信嬉皮士是精神错乱的精神病患者。

Why did Walt Disney produce a fraudulent documentary that told us Lemmings follow each other off cliffs? So we would believe it.
为什么沃尔特·迪斯尼（Walt Disney）制作了一部欺诈性的纪录片，告诉我们旅鼠在悬崖上互相追随？所以我们会相信它。

Why did The Beatles tell us to fear the taxman, to scoff at revolution, chase nonsense conspiracy theories, and that happiness is a warm gun? So we would believe it.
为什么披头士乐队告诉我们要害怕税务员，嘲笑革命，追逐无稽之谈的阴谋论，幸福是一把温暖的枪？所以我们会相信它。

Why did Easy Rider tell us that the hippie movement was dead? So we would believe it.
为什么逍遥骑士告诉我们嬉皮士运动已经死了？所以我们会相信它。

Why did Chinatown end with defeatism in the face of massive corruption? So we would believe it.
为什么唐人街在面对大规模腐败时以失败主义告终？所以我们会相信它。

Why did George Orwell tell us of a hellish future of totalitarian control that we are powerless to stop? So we would believe it.
为什么乔治·奥威尔告诉我们一个我们无力阻止的极权主义控制的地狱般的未来？所以我们会相信它。

Why did Wall Street tell us “greed is good”? So we would believe it.
为什么华尔街告诉我们“贪婪是好的”？所以我们会相信它。

Why did Do The Right Thing tell us we’re all racially tribalized? So we would believe it.
为什么做正确的事告诉我们，我们都是种族部落化的？所以我们会相信它。

Why did Simpsons creator Matt Groening make a comic strip called Life in Hell? So we would believe it.
为什么辛普森一家的创作者马特·格罗宁要制作一部名为《地狱生活》的漫画？所以我们会相信它。

And on, and on, and on, and on. When it comes to any popular media, if you ask yourself the question, “Why would secret doomsday cult kleptocrats want the public to consume this?”, you will find your answers.
不停地，不停地，不停地，不停地。当谈到任何流行媒体时，如果你问自己一个问题，“为什么秘密的末日邪教盗贼希望公众消费这个？”，你会找到你的答案。

This is obviously very bad news, but the biggest lie we’ve been told is that we are powerless. We’ve got one way out of hellworld, and that’s for the public to realize that we’ve been conned completely so we can build a united movement that shatters every lie they’ve told us, mocks this rotten farce as loudly as it deserves, and aims at nothing short of abolishing our criminal government so we can build one that serves the public.
这显然是一个非常坏的消息，但我们被告知的最大谎言是我们无能为力。我们只有一条出路可以摆脱地狱世界，那就是让公众意识到我们完全被骗了，这样我们就可以建立一个团结的运动，粉碎他们告诉我们的每一个谎言，尽可能大声地嘲笑这场腐朽的闹剧，并致力于废除我们的犯罪政府，这样我们就可以建立一个为公众服务的国家。

To understand this story is to see right through the con, to become immune to the endless sea of criminal propaganda, and to feel the great joy and power that comes with freedom.
要理解这个故事，就要看穿骗局，对无尽的犯罪宣传海洋免疫，并感受到自由带来的巨大快乐和力量。

If a small number of people quickly put on these truth-colored glasses, we are in for an unimaginably bright future. If not, we get an apocalypse.
如果一小撮人迅速戴上这些真理的眼镜，我们将迎来一个难以想象的光明未来。如果没有，我们就会得到一个启示录。

For more information, I’ve put together this booklet that includes other major findings and a map to a sea of proof, along with all the other essays on this site.
为了了解更多信息，我整理了这本小册子，其中包括其他主要发现和证据之海的地图，以及本网站上的所有其他文章。

For the true history of America since the end of World War II, see here.

To see this discovery unfold in real-time, along with further explanations, hundreds of pieces of evidence not covered here, advice, inspiration, political theory, and the heart and soul of a man escaping history’s largest doomsday cult, see my Instagram story highlights. I apologize for leaving things so scattered, but this has been an exhausting affair. So long as you understand this (true) ideology, you will be able to learn the whole story.
要看到这一发现的实时展开，以及进一步的解释，数百条此处未涵盖的证据，建议，灵感，政治理论，以及逃离历史上最大的世界末日邪教的人的心灵和灵魂，请参阅我的Instagram故事集锦。我很抱歉把事情弄得如此分散，但这是一件令人筋疲力尽的事情。只要你理解了这种（真正的）意识形态，你就能了解整个故事。

Here is a federal lawsuit I filed against dozens of perpetrators of the cryptocurrency Ponzi – not for litigation, but just to preserve the information and attach my name to it. I was terrified and hadn’t slept in days and it shows, but it served its purpose of keeping myself alive long enough to keep learning and telling this story.
这是我对数十名加密货币庞氏骗局的肇事者提起的联邦诉讼——不是为了诉讼，而只是为了保存信息并附上我的名字。我很害怕，已经好几天没有睡觉了，它表明，但它达到了让自己活得足够长的时间以继续学习和讲述这个故事的目的。

I no longer have my original research files from the crypto rabbit hole. If you want to see them, you’ll have to get my laptop back from the government. Ask them how they got it - it’s a very fun story.
我不再拥有来自加密兔子洞的原始研究文件。如果你想看他们，你必须从政府那里拿回我的笔记本电脑。问他们是怎么得到的——这是一个非常有趣的故事。

I hope you know how powerful you are. I wish you a hell of a lot more than luck.
我希望你知道你有多强大。祝你比运气好得多。
